Changes since ldep_1_0_beta:
Changes since SSRL_APPS_rtems_4_9_20080922:
 - handle weak undefined symbols ('w') simply as undefined ('U')
 - BUGFIX: overriding existing symbol type was broken when adding
   support for weak symbols. A helper routine was added rating
   symbols according to their 'significance' (undef < weak < strong)
   and the type is now only overriden if the significance of the
   new symbol is greater than the significance of the existing definition.
 - added -v option to print version info (CVS tag + Id)
 - weak symbols hopefully work now: when detecting multiple
   symbol definitions allow new strong definition to override
   the symbol type introduced by the old weak def.
   (The xref to the old definition still bears the WEAK flag).
   No 'type mismatch' warning is emitted if either the old
   or new definition is weak.
 - BUGFIX: string argument to log message printing main
   symbol name (-Aman_sym) was missing.
 - '-U' option added. Assume all undefined symbols in
   the application link-set will ultimately be provided by
   start files, linker script etc.
 - ChangeLog added
