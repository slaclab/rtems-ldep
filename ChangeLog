Changes since SSRL_APPS_rtems_4_9_20080922:
 - weak symbols hopefully work now: when detecting multiple
   symbol definitions allow new strong definition to override
   the symbol type introduced by the old weak def.
   (The xref to the old definition still bears the WEAK flag).
   No 'type mismatch' warning is emitted if either the old
   or new definition is weak.
 - BUGFIX: string argument to log message printing main
   symbol name (-Aman_sym) was missing.
 - '-U' option added. Assume all undefined symbols in
   the application link-set will ultimately be provided by
   start files, linker script etc.
 - ChangeLog added
